## 🫀 Overview

Cardio-Monitor is an intelligent web application designed to assess heart disease risk through advanced machine learning algorithms.
This application leverages real-time data processing and predictive modeling to provide early detection capabilities with **92% accuracy**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Heart disease remains the leading cause of death globally, accounting for millions of deaths annually. Early detection and continuous monitoring are crucial for reducing mortality rates. Traditional diagnostic methods often detect heart conditions only after significant progression, limiting treatment effectiveness.

## 💡 Solution

Our solution combines:
- **Real-time streaming data analytics** using Apache Spark
- **Machine learning algorithms** for predictive modeling
- **IoT integration** for wearable sensor data
- **Big data processing** for continuous health monitoring

This approach provides a cost-effective, scalable platform for early heart disease detection through real-time data analysis and in-memory computations.
